Caesar Cipher Project:

This is a simple Python implementation of a Caesar Cipher for encrypting and decrypting messages using a basic shift method.

How It Works:

The program asks the user whether they want to encode (encrypt) or decode (decrypt) a message.

The user inputs their message and the shift number (key).

The program then performs a shift on the alphabet and outputs the encoded or decoded result.

It also supports special characters, spaces, and numbers, which are left unchanged.
